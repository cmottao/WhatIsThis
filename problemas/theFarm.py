    4. The farmer's corral was damaged and he doesn't know whether to re-enclose the corral with wood, wire 
    or put a metal fence. If you are going to fence with wood you should put 4 rows of boards, with rod 8 rows 
    and with wire only 5 rows, he wants to know what is the least expensive for fencing if you know that the 
    barbed wire is worth P per meter, the boards at Q per meter and the rods S per meter. Given the size of the 
    pen and the prices of the elements, what enclosure is the most economical?
